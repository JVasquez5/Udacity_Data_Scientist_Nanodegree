    "Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Pick a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prepare data:\n",
    "    * Gather necessary data to answer your questions\n",
    "    * Handle categorical and missing data\n",
    "    * Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them\n",
    "* Analyze, Model, and Visualize\n",
    "    * Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.\n",
    "4) Communicate your business insights:\n",
    "    * Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind\n",
    "    * Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables will be a Github repo and a blog post. Use the rubric here to assist in successfully completing this project!"
